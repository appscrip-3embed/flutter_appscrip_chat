# Isometrik Flutter Chat SDK

`Isometrik Flutter Chat SDK` is a package to support chat functionality for flutter projects

## Setup

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the platform-specific guides:

- [Android](./README_android.md)

- [iOS](./README_ios.md)

- [Web](./README_web.md)

## Initialization

Before using the Isometrik Flutter Chat SDK, you need to ensure the necessary initializations are done.

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await LocalNoticeService().setup();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Explanation

`await LocalNoticeService().setup()`:
Sets up the local notification service. This ensures that the app can handle in-app notifications properly.

## Usage

The Isometrik Flutter Chat SDK supports various use cases to enhance your chat functionality:

1. Configuration : Set the configuration for account ID, project ID, keyset ID, license key, app secret, user secret, MQTT host, and port.
2. Attachments and Features: Specify the types of attachments and features you need in the chat.(e.g., image, video, location, contat, voice)
3. Customization: Customize the chat UI by setting the chat theme, chat bubble color, and message bubble type
4. User Management: Manage users by setting the user ID, user name, and user avatar.
5. Chat History: Retrieve chat history from local database of device with conversationId and opponentUserId.
6. Chat Message: Send chat messages with text, image, video, location, contact, and voice attachments.
7. Configuration Objects: Create configuration objects for the app and user.
8. Start a chat: you'll need to integrate the `IsmChatApp` widget into your application

```dart
IsmChatApp(
    context: context,
    chatPageProperties: chatPageProperties(),
    conversationProperties: conversationProperties(),
    chatTheme: chatTheme(),
    chatDarkTheme: chatDarkTheme(),
    loadingDialog: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    noChatSelectedPlaceholder: Text('No chat selected'),
    sideWidgetWidth: 300,
    fontFamily: 'OpenSans',
    conversationParser: (conversationData) () {
        // parse conversation data
    } ,
    conversationModifier: (conversationData) () {
        // modify conversation data
        } ,
);
```

##### Required Parameters

- `context`: The BuildContext of the application.
- `chatPageProperties`: The properties for the chat page.
- `conversationProperties`: The properties for the conversation.

9. Initialize Chat and MQTT: The initialize method sets up the necessary configurations for using the `Isometrik Flutter Chat SDK` in your Flutter project. This method must be called before using any other features of the Isometrik Flutter Chat SDK.And Manually initializes the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol for real-time messaging. .

```dart
    IsmChat.i.initialize(
        IsmChatCommunicationConfig communicationConfig, {
        bool useDatabase = true,
        String databaseName = IsmChatStrings.dbname,
        NotificaitonCallback? showNotification,
        BuildContext? context,
        bool shouldSetupMqtt = false,
    })
```

10. Add listener for MQTT events: Adds a listener to handle MQTT events. This is useful for responding to real-time message updates and other events.

```dart
IsmChat.i.addEventListener( (listener){
     // Handle MQTT events
})
```

11. Remove MQTT listener events: Remove listener which you added addMqttListenerto handle MQTT events.

```dart
IsmChat.i.removeEventListener((event) {
    // Handle MQTT events
})
```

12. This method is use to listen for MQTT events, which are typically messages or notifications received in real-time through the MQTT protocol.Call this method when assuming that the MQTT connection is already established.

```dart
    final eventModel = EventModel();
    IsmChat.i.listenMqttEvent(
        event: eventModel,
        showNotification: (notification) {
        // Handle notification display
        },
    );
```

13. `Only For Web`: This method is use when you need to ensure that the third column is visible or not in web flow. Their visibility based on user actions or web flow state.

```dart
    // Show the third column if needed
    IsmChat.i.showThirdColumn();

     // Close the third column if needed
     IsmChat.i.clostThirdColumn();
```

14. `Only For Web`: This method use to assign null on the current conversation.

```dart
    IsmChat.i.changeCurrentConversation();
```

```

18. This methid use for retrieves the list of users who are not blocked and returns a list of `SelectedMembers` objects.

```dart
    final selectedMembers = await IsmChat.i.getNonBlockUserList();
```

19. This property retrieves all conversations of the current user and returns a list of `IsmChatConversationModel` objects.

```dart
    final conversations = await IsmChat.i.userConversations;
```

20. This property retrieves the total count of unread conversations and returns an integer value.

```dart
     final unreadCount = await IsmChat.i.unreadCount;
